Defining the Decision Problem
=========================================================================

In this chapter, we will discuss how to define the decision problem using network science and complexity theory.

Understanding the Complexity of the Decision Problem
----------------------------------------------------

The first step in defining the decision problem is to understand its complexity. Complex decisions are those that have many interrelated factors and involve uncertainty and ambiguity.

To understand the complexity of the decision problem, businesses should:

* Identify all of the factors that influence the decision
* Analyze the relationships between these factors
* Consider how external factors such as the economy or regulatory environment may impact the decision

By understanding the complexity of the decision problem, businesses can make more informed decisions and anticipate potential risks and opportunities.

Identifying the Decision to Be Made
-----------------------------------

Once the complexity of the decision problem has been understood, the next step is to identify the decision to be made. This involves:

* Clarifying the purpose of the decision
* Identifying the stakeholders who will be impacted by the decision
* Considering the short-term and long-term implications of the decision

By identifying the decision to be made, businesses can focus their attention on the most important factors and make more informed decisions.

Representing the Decision Problem Graphically
---------------------------------------------

Once the decision problem has been defined, it can be represented graphically as a decision network. A decision network is a visual representation of the factors that influence the decision and how they are related.

By representing the decision problem graphically, businesses can better understand the complexity of the decision and identify potential areas for improvement.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, defining the decision problem using network science and complexity theory involves understanding the complexity of the decision problem, identifying the decision to be made, and representing the decision problem graphically. By using these techniques, businesses can make more informed decisions and anticipate potential risks and opportunities.
